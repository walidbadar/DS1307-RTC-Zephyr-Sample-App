DS1307: RTC Module
#######################################################

Overview
********
This sample application periodically reads date and time data from the DS1307 RTC module, and displays on the console.

Requirements
************
The DS1307 is a real-time clock module that keeps track of the current date and time using a 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator. It communicates via I2C and includes a battery backup to maintain time even when the main power is off.
